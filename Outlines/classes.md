### Overview ###

#### First Year ####

***Expectations***

- In comparison to *traditional* subjects, such as math and physics, **Computer Science** (CS) classes differ in their organization, requirements, assignments, subject matter changes, etc.
- Programming assignments are (almost always) longer than they seem and worth the most – typically 40-50% of your grade.
- Be prepared to work with partners, as it is highly encouraged.
- Understand that solving a problem *on-paper* is significantly different than `programming` its solution.

***Classes***

- Excluding `ECS20`, lower-divison CS classes are more programming intensive.
- For the following list of classes, we are providing class-specific expectations and insight that seniors wish they had known when they were a freshman.
- Official course descriptions can be found on the department's website.

`ECS36A` & `ECS36B`

- Teaches the fundamentals of computer programming and helps you design simple algorithms.
	- `ECS36A` will be taught in `Python`.
	- `ECS36B` will be taught in `C++`.
	- Expect more programming in `ECS36B` than `ECS36A`.
	- Be sure to develop a strong understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) in `ECS36B` (see `ECS36C`).

`ECS36C`

- Transitions you from being just a programmer to a **real** computer scientist.
	- Like `ECS36B`, this course is also programming heavy.
	- If you are not yet comfortable with OOP (`ECS36B`), this course will be a `!(walk-in-the-park)`.
	- Again, as one of the *weeder* classes, this class will break you if you aren't prepared!

`ECS50`

- Teaches the basics of low-level, assembly programming and computer operations.
	- Generally accepted as one of the *easier* and less stressful lower-division classes.
	- However, debugging assembly code is also generally accepted as strenuous and annoying.
	- Serves as a good introduction to computer architecture.
	- You'll be learning a little bit about how your computer works!

`ECS20`

- Teaches you discrete mathematics.
	- No programming! Yay?
	- This class is often overlooked, however, it provides the **foundation** for many of the upper-divison classes, and Computer Science as a whole.
	- The material will introduce the kinds of questions that come up in technical interviews.
	- If you're planning on going to grad school, you better do well in this class!

***Non-Major/Minor Classes***

`ECS32A`

- Teaches basic programming concepts.
	- Taught in `Python`.
	- Intended for students with little or no prior programming experiences.

`ECS32B`

- Teaches the principles of OOP, as well as data structures.
	- Taught in `Python`.

`ECS34`

- Serves as a transition, weeder, and or form of evalution in becoming a CS major.
	- Will extensively cover the principles of OOP and the UNIX operating system (OS).

#### Choosing Classes ####

***Choose Your Classes Wisely***

- Sometimes, taking only 3 classes can be stressful, depending on which classes you take.
- For example, scheduling a quarter with `ECS150`, `ECS160`, and `ECS175` would likely be immensely stressful, as they are all programming intensive.

***Balance Programming & Theory***

- Try to schedule your quarters with a mix of programming and theory classes.
- If you're planning on scheduling a quarter with only CS classes, consider (`ECS120` or `122A`), `ECS140`, and `ECS154A`.
	- There is one theory class (`ECS120` and `122A`), one programming class (`ECS140`), and a class that is in-between (`ECS154A`).

***Optimize Your Workload***

- Ideally, you should aim to take 13-16 units and 2-3 CS classes per quarter, mixing CS and other classes.
	- Taking 2 CS classes is ideal as it allows for a good balance and **avoid** taking more than 3.
- Adding a GE to your schedule each quarter will keep you sane!
- If you are planning on scheduling *more* units (20+), then the classes you choose becomes even more crucial.
	- With a schedule of 5-6 classes, take (1-2) easy GE classes, (1-2) programming CS classes, (1) theory,  *easy*, or *light-load* CS class, (1) writing class (UWP) if you aren't taking `ECS188`, and or (1) math class to fulfill the math requirement.
	- **Warning**: if you hate math, taking a physics class, a theory CS class, *and* a math class will be overkill on math.

#### Electives ####

- As a CS major, you will have a lot of freedom when it comes to your electives.
- As a CSE major, you have 4 electives to choose from, so choose wisely and make them count!
	- However, there is no harm in doing more than 4!
- In general, electives specialize in a specific area within Computer Science.
	- Take electives that are relevant to the area that you want to specialize in.
	- However, don't be afraid to take an elective (in a different subfield of CS) that sounds interesting becuase you might end up liking it!

***Electives by Subfield***

#### MAT & STA Benefits ####

- A lot of CS is more mathematics and statistics than programming.
- Regardless of the subfield(s) of CS that you might be interested in, there is most likely an equivalent mathematics or statics class.
	- Taking these *equivalent* classes from their respective departments allows you to learn from a non-CS perspective.
- Many of these classes count towards your electives or math requirement and will definitely look better on your transcript.
	- For some classes that aren't already listed as electives, you can petition for them to be counted as an elective towards your CS degree!

***MAT Classes To Consider***

| CLASS		| TITLE					| CS RELATED AREAS                          |

### Registration ###

***Pass Times***

- *Pass Times* are determined entirely on the number of (1) UC Davis and (2) non-exam transfer units completed.
- The first day of passes are always reserved for students that are athletes or in the honors program.

*Pass 1*

- Register for the classes that you wish you take, assuming that you've met their pre-reqs. and there are open seats.
- **Unit Cap** - You may register for up to **17 units**.

*Open Registration*

- Registration period between *Pass 1* and *Pass 2*.
- **Unit Cap** - You may register for up to **17 units**.

*Pass 2*

- Typically, you will be waitlisting for classes.
- **Unit Cap** - You may register for up to **19 units**.

*Schedule Adjustments*

- Registration and waitlisting, assuming that you've met their pre-reqs., after *Pass 2*.
- No major restrictions.
- **Unit Cap** - You may register for up to **28.5 units**.

***Waitlists***

- If there's a class that you really want to take but doesn't have any open seats, you should definitely waitlist!
- Being *high* on a waitlist doesn't mean that you're always going to get in. Each classes' waitlist is different!
- A longer waitlist means a higher-demand class.
- In most cases, departments will first look to see if they can add more seats to the class, or even another section, to accomodate for more students.
	- However, if there's another instructor teaching the same course and has open seats in their section, then the department **will not** expand the class.
- **Students always drop classes.**
	- Sometimes because of the difficulty of the class.
	- Mostly because they were using the class as a placeholder/back-up.
- Always remember to be enrolled in enough units in case you don't get into the class(es) that you're waitlisted for.
- Regardless of whether there is a high or low chance of you getting off a waitlist for a class, always remember to register for another class that has open seats.
	- In most circumstances, taking your back-up class shouldn't have a negative impact on your college career.

***Restriction***

- Some upper-division classes, mostly math and statistics, are major restricted.
	- This means that students in certain majors can register for their respective classes during *Pass 1*.
- Therefore, your only option in getting into these classes is to waitlist.
	- Many of MAT/STA classes are expanded and or offered more frequently because of the high-demand/popularity among CS majors.

***Replacements***

- It is completely normal to not get into a class that you really wanted to take.
	- If a class' demand increases, the department might offer it more frequently.
	- Instead, try taking classes that satisfy your major or elective requirements.
	- If you have GEs to take, now would be a great time to take them.
- If relevant, you can take another class for your other major(s) or minor(s).

### Academic Success ###

- Attend lectures (duh). Not everyone attends lecture. From experience, about 30-40% of the class won't attend lectures. Sometimes, only about 20% show up!
	- Go to lecture, and ask questions. instructors will give you more attention.
	- More importantly, even if you know the material, you'll learn something new.
	- You can have a 1-1 interaction with your professor.
- Go to office hours! Textbooks are not too helpful most of the times. If you have questions, go to OH and get your questions cleared.
	- Again, not everyone attends OH, so you have more 1-1 time with your instructor and can get questions cleared faster.
	- TA's OH are actually helpful despite what a lot of people think.
		- Not a lot of people know that most TA's schedule their OH depending on when exams and OH are due.
		- They will help you out with homework (and sometimes help you more on a homework assignment than a professor!)
- If your class uses piazza for discussions, ask questions! You can even post anonymously if you want! It gets your questions cleared a lot faster and sometimes the student answers are top notch!
- Seek help from tutors at Kemper 75! Tutoring is (and will always be) free for everyone. Tutoring at Kemper 75 takes place Monday through Friday.
	- These tutors have taken the class at Davis previously and have done well.
	- Simply write your name on the whiteboard or simply yell out the name of the tutor if there are not a lot of people.
	- Tutors also host review sessions for a lot of ECS classes.
	- Tutoring is offered for all lower division classes and an increasing number of upper division cs classes with every passing quarter.
- Start programming assignments early regardless of the difficulty. There are programs that will take you about 20-30 hours to complete. Start early and make sure you get questions cleared early!
	- More often than not, programming assignments are longer than they seem.
- Help out fellow classmates :)
	- Again, not a lot of people know this but by helping someone who is struggling with a concept only makes you learn better!
- Not everyone has time to read ahead of class and go to lecture. In fact, almost no one would do this for upper division classes at least. However, try to read/re-read the concepts that you learned in class at the end of the day. It will definitely prove to be useful since you don't need to waste time refreshing your memory while studying for an exam.
- Get sleep! Your mental and physical health is most important!

### Double Major and Minor ###

- CS is a highly impacted major and there are a lot of students in the major. Minoring in CS might be a pretty difficult task since you pretty much need to take all the lower division classes and take 5 upper division courses. In a sense, it is not too far away from getting a major in CS.

- If you're a minor in CS, you will not get the opportunity to register for CS classes in pass 1 and you have to waitlist.

- If you've completed the important lower divisions (OOP, Data Structures, Discrete Math), either the first of the chem or physics series, and a few math classes, you should be allowed to declare a major in CS.
	- Similar requirements for CSE (some might differ).
	- If you want to declare a CS major, your GPA should be above 3.

### CS versus CSE ###

- CSE as a major focuses roughly on 80% CS and about 20% in EE. If you're interested in hardware and working with embedded systems, then you should definitely be a CSE major.

- CSE has a lot of core requirements to complete. There are 3 EE classes that you must take, the entire physics 9 series and a math class on differential equations. All of these classes are considered to be core engineering classes.

- There's only room for 4 electives that you can take. Some might see this as not enough room to try out other classes because of the heavy course load.

- If you're interested in any other specific subfield of CS, you should probably be a CS major since you have more flexibility to take classes that you might be interested in. Additionally, it is a lot more easier to double major or minor in another field!

- If you know that you want to be involved in software development, the job opportunities are about the same regardless of choosing CS or CSE as your major.

- Quote about jobs in the future from Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google SVP of Engineering (responsible for Google’s efforts around the Chrome and Android operating systems and the Google Play store):

	> The intersection of hardware and software is really important. I think that people will always interact with things. So people with the skills to [control the interface between software and hardware] will be in high demand. It’s a broad set of skills, by the way. It’s software engineering, electrical engineering, ergonomics, industrial design, materials, mechanical engineering, batteries. I think there will be even more gadgets in the future that do different kinds of things we haven’t even imagined. Building those things will require this diverse set of skills.




***CSE Class Differences***

- In comparison to CS majors, CSE majors have required `EEC`, `ENG`, `PHY`, and additional `ECS` classes.
