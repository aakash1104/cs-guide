# Classes Outline

## CS Classes Overview

### First Year CS Classes and Expectations

- CS classes operate differently than a traditional Math, Physics, or any
other class.
	- Programming assignments are longer than they seem.
	- Working with a partner is highly encouraged.
	- Understanding how to solve a problem in a text level is actually different
	than programming the solution.
	-  Programming assignments are worth more than
	anything else (roughly 40-50% of your grade sometimes)

- Here we provide what a student can expect taking the lower division classes.
 	- This is not providing you with course descriptions. See the department
	website for that.
	- This just tells you what you can expect and provides other insights that
	one would wish they knew as a freshman taking these classes.

- Lower division CS classes are more programming intensive (with the exception
	 of ECS 20).
	- **ECS 36A and 36B** are meant to teach you the fundamentals of computer
	programming and help you design simple algorithms.
		- _36A will be taught in Python!_
		- 36B is meant to be hard and is the first weeder course that the
		department offers.
		- Expect to program a lot in 36B.
		- _36B will be taught in C++_
	- **ECS 36C** is the course that coverts you from being just a programmer
	 to an actual computer scientist.
		- This is a programming heavy course too!
		- If you are not comfortable with OOP (36B),
		this course will break you.
		- Typically the second weeder course the department offers.
	- **ECS 50** teaches you the basics of assembly programming and basic
	computer operations.
		- Generally not a hard class. Typically of the easier
		and less stressful lower division classes in the department.
		- Good intro to computer architecture. debugging assembly language is
		strenuous.
		- You'll learn a little bit about how your computer works.
	- **ECS 20** is a course on discrete mathematics.
		- No programming
		- People generally take this class less seriously but it is the foundation
		of what is actually termed "computer science"
		- The material also comes up in technical interviews.
		- Foundation for a lot of upper division classes.
		- If you want to go to grad school, you better do well in this class!

_Non - Major and Minor Lower Division CS classes_

- **ECS 32A** is an introductory class in programming. This class is intended
for non-majors and students who have had no prior programming experience. This class will be taught in _Python_.

- **ECS 32B** is a class on teaching you the principles of object oriented programming, and data structures in _Python_.

- **ECS 34** is a transition (and a weeder) course to become a part of the major.
	- Will cover extensive OOP principles and the UNIX OS!


## How to Choose classes

### Passes and how they're determined

- **Pass 1**: Register for classes you want to take (assuming you've met
the pre-reqs and there are open seats).
	- _Unit Cap_: You can only register for _17 units_ at this point in time.

- **Pass 2**: Typically used for waitlisting to get into a class.
	- _Unit Cap_: Your unit cap is extended to _19 units_ at this point.

- **Open Registration**: This is a period between the end of pass 1 and the
start of pass 2 and after the end of pass 2.
 	- _Unit Cap_: if between pass 1 and 2, then 17 units. If after pass 2, 19
	units.

- **Schedule Adjustment**: Register or waitlist for any class (that you've met
the pre-reqs for). No major restriction.
	- _Unit Cap_: extended to _28.5 units_. Doesn't mean you have to do that
	much and go overboard.

#### How Are Pass Times Determined

- Almost entirely based  on the number of UC Davis and Non-exam based
transfer units completed.

- First day of passes is always reserved for student athletes and students in
the honors program.

### Dealing with waitlists

- If you want to get into a class that you really want to take but its filled
up, _definitely waitlist_!

- The higher you are on the waitlist does not imply that you won't get into the
class.
	- If there are a lot of people on the waitlist, it means the class has a
	high demand.
	- The department will first look to see if they can expand the class
	and possibly add another section to accommodate more students.
		- If there's another instructor teaching the course that has open seats
		then the department _will not_ expand the class.
	- Students _always_ drop classes.
		- Sometimes because of the difficulty but mostly because the class
		was probably a placeholder.

- Always make sure you have enough units registered in case you don't get
into the class you waitlisted for.

- If you really think that you might not get into the class, then make sure you
register for another class that has open seats. You could just take that class
in the worst case.

#### Major Restrictive Classes & Waitlists

- Some upper division classes (mostly Math and Stats) are major restrictive
	- Only people in that or related majors can register for the class in pass 1.

- Your only option to get into the class is to waitlist.
	- A lot of these classes are typically expanded.

- Some of these classes are very popular among CS majors and the MAT/STA
department is aware of this and do definitely try to expand classes or
offer these classes more frequently.

### Replacement Classes

### Doing well in classes

## CS Electives

- If you're a CS major, then you have a lot more freedom with electives and
more room to choose your electives according to what you like.

- If you're CSE, then you have 4 electives so choose them wisely and make it
count.
	- Of course, there's no harm in doing more than 4 electives.

- Typically electives are classes in a specific area of Computer Science.
	- Take those classes that you would ideally want to specialize in.
	- If you are interested in a specific sub-field of CS, take a class based
	on that elective to decide if you actually like it.

_Here are some classes that the department offers based on certain
subfields of CS:_

## Declaring a minor and/or a double major

## Advantages of taking more math/stats classes

- A lot of computer science is mathematics and Statistics than it is Programming.

- Regardless of the specific field of CS that you might be interested in,
	there is an equivalent class offered by either the mathematics or statistics
	department.

- Take the classes from these departments to learn these topics from a
	different perspective. You will learn a lot more and things might make
	more sense to you.

- Some of these classes count as electives for your major too and it will
definitely look better on your transcript.
	- You can even petition certain classes to be counted for your electives
	(if they are not already listed as electives)
