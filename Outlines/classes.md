# Classes Outline

## CS Classes Overview

### First Year CS Classes and Expectations

- CS classes operate differently than a traditional Math, Physics, or any
other class.
	- Programming assignments are longer than they seem.
	- Working with a partner is highly encouraged.
	- Understanding how to solve a problem in a text level is actually different
	than programming the solution.
	-  Programming assignments are worth more than
	anything else (roughly 40-50% of your grade sometimes)

- Here we provide what a student can expect taking the lower division classes.
 	- This is not providing you with course descriptions. See the department
	website for that.
	- This just tells you what you can expect and provides other insights that
	one would wish they knew as a freshman taking these classes.

- Lower division CS classes are more programming intensive (with the exception
	 of ECS 20).
	- **ECS 36A and 36B** are meant to teach you the fundamentals of computer
	programming and help you design simple algorithms.
		- _36A will be taught in Python!_
		- 36B is meant to be hard and is the first weeder course that the
		department offers.
		- Expect to program a lot in 36B.
		- _36B will be taught in C++_
	- **ECS 36C** is the course that coverts you from being just a programmer
	 to an actual computer scientist.
		- This is a programming heavy course too!
		- If you are not comfortable with OOP (36B),
		this course will break you.
		- Typically the second weeder course the department offers.
	- **ECS 50** teaches you the basics of assembly programming and basic
	computer operations.
		- Generally not a hard class. Typically of the easier
		and less stressful lower division classes in the department.
		- Good intro to computer architecture. debugging assembly language is
		strenuous.
		- You'll learn a little bit about how your computer works.
	- **ECS 20** is a course on discrete mathematics.
		- No programming
		- People generally take this class less seriously but it is the foundation
		of what is actually termed "computer science"
		- The material also comes up in technical interviews.
		- Foundation for a lot of upper division classes.
		- If you want to go to grad school, you better do well in this class!

_Non - Major and Minor Lower Division CS classes_

- **ECS 32A** is an introductory class in programming. This class is intended
for non-majors and students who have had no prior programming experience. This class will be taught in _Python_.

- **ECS 32B** is a class on teaching you the principles of object oriented programming, and data structures in _Python_.

- **ECS 34** is a transition (and a weeder) course to become a part of the major.
	- Will cover extensive OOP principles and the UNIX OS!


## How to Choose classes

- Choose classes wisely. Sometimes even taking 3 classes can be stressful
depending on the classes you take.
	- For example: Taking ECS 150, 175, and 160 in one quarter might be super
	stressful since they are all programming intensive.

- Take classes that are a mix of programming and theory classes.
	- If you plan on taking only CS classes in a quarter, consider something
	like this:
	 ECS 120/122A, ECS 140, ECS 154A.
		- There's one theory class, one programming class, and a class
			that is in between the two.

- Ideally try to take about 15-16 units a quarter with a mix of CS and other
classes.
	- Try not to do more than 3 CS classes in a quarter. It can get
		quite strenuous.
		- Ideally, shoot for 2 CS classes as that creates a perfect
			balance.
	- Adding a GE in your schedule will keep you sane during the quarter.

- If you want to take more units (more than 20), then choose your classes
wisely.
	- If you're taking 5-6 classes in a quarter, then:
		- Take a relatively easy GE (or even two) class.
		- Try to take 1 (ideally) or a maximum of two CS classes that are programming
		heavy.
		- Take a theory related CS class (or something that has a lighter load than a
		typical CS class)
		- If you're not taking ECS 188, then you can take a writing class
		(UWP)
		- Take a math class to fulfill your math requirements.

	- Taking a physics class, a theory CS class, and a math class is just
	an overkill on math and might make you crazy if you hate math.


### Passes and how they're determined

- **Pass 1**: Register for classes you want to take (assuming you've met
the pre-reqs and there are open seats).
	- _Unit Cap_: You can only register for _17 units_ at this point in time.

- **Pass 2**: Typically used for waitlisting to get into a class.
	- _Unit Cap_: Your unit cap is extended to _19 units_ at this point.

- **Open Registration**: This is a period between the end of pass 1 and the
start of pass 2 and after the end of pass 2.
 	- _Unit Cap_: if between pass 1 and 2, then 17 units. If after pass 2, 19
	units.

- **Schedule Adjustment**: Register or waitlist for any class (that you've met
the pre-reqs for). No major restriction.
	- _Unit Cap_: extended to _28.5 units_. Doesn't mean you have to do that
	much and go overboard.

#### How Are Pass Times Determined

- Almost entirely based  on the number of UC Davis and Non-exam based
transfer units completed.

- First day of passes is always reserved for student athletes and students in
the honors program.

### Dealing with waitlists

- If you want to get into a class that you really want to take but its filled
up, _definitely waitlist_!

- The higher you are on the waitlist does not imply that you won't get into the
class.
	- If there are a lot of people on the waitlist, it means the class has a
	high demand.
	- The department will first look to see if they can expand the class
	and possibly add another section to accommodate more students.
		- If there's another instructor teaching the course that has open seats
		then the department _will not_ expand the class.
	- Students _always_ drop classes.
		- Sometimes because of the difficulty but mostly because the class
		was probably a placeholder.

- Always make sure you have enough units registered in case you don't get
into the class you waitlisted for.

- If you really think that you might not get into the class, then make sure you
register for another class that has open seats. You could just take that class
in the worst case.

#### Major Restrictive Classes & Waitlists

- Some upper division classes (mostly Math and Stats) are major restrictive
	- Only people in that or related majors can register for the class in pass 1.

- Your only option to get into the class is to waitlist.
	- A lot of these classes are typically expanded.

- Some of these classes are very popular among CS majors and the MAT/STA
department is aware of this and do definitely try to expand classes or
offer these classes more frequently.

### Replacement Classes

- It is completely normal to not get into a class you really wanted to take.
	- If the demand increases, the department might offer it more frequently.

- Instead try to take classes that satisfy your major requirements. If you
have some GEs left to complete, now would be a good time to take them.

- You could also take other CS courses that might have open seats and maybe
complete on of your electives.

- If you're minoring in some field, take a class that satisfies your minor.

### Doing well in classes

- Attend lectures (duh). Not everyone attends lecture. From experience, about
30-40% of the class won't attend lectures. Sometimes, only about 20% show up!
	- Go to lecture, and ask questions. instructors will give you more attention.
	- More importantly, even if you know the material, you'll learn something new.
	- You can have a 1-1 interaction with your professor.

- Go to office hours! Textbooks are not too helpful most of the times. If you
have questions, go to OH and get your questions cleared.
	- Again, not everyone attends OH, so you have more 1-1 time with your
	instructor and can get questions cleared faster.
	- TA's OH are actually helpful despite what a lot of people think.
		- Not a lot of people know that most TA's schedule their OH
		depending on when exams and OH are due.
		- They will help you out with homework (and sometimes help you more
			on a homework assignment than a professor!)

- If your class uses piazza for discussions, ask questions! You can even
post anonymously if you want! It gets your questions cleared a lot faster
and sometimes the student answers are top notch!

- Start programming assignments early regardless of the difficulty.
There are programs that will take you about 20-30 hours to complete.
Start early and make sure you get questions cleared early!

- Help out fellow classmates :)
	- Again, not a lot of people know this but by helping someone who is
	struggling with a concept only makes you learn better!

- Not everyone has time to read ahead of class and go to lecture. In fact,
almost no one would do this for upper division classes at least. However, try
to read/re-read the concepts that you learned in class at the end of the day.
It will definitely prove to be useful since you don't need to waste time
refreshing your memory while studying for an exam.

## CS Electives

- If you're a CS major, then you have a lot more freedom with electives and
more room to choose your electives according to what you like.

- If you're CSE, then you have 4 electives so choose them wisely and make it
count.
	- Of course, there's no harm in doing more than 4 electives.

- Typically electives are classes in a specific area of Computer Science.
	- Take those classes that you would ideally want to specialize in.
	- If you are interested in a specific sub-field of CS, take a class based
	on that elective to decide if you actually like it.

_Here are some classes that the department offers based on certain
subfields of CS:_

### Data Science

## Declaring a minor and/or a double major

- CS is a highly impacted major and there are a lot of students in the major.
Minoring in CS might be a pretty difficult task since you pretty much
need to take all the lower division classes and take 5 upper division
courses. In a sense, it is not too far away from getting a major in CS.

- If you're a minor in CS, you will not get the opportunity to register for
CS classes in pass 1 and you have to waitlist.

- If you've completed the important lower divisions (OOP, Data Structures,
	Discrete Math), either the first of the chem or physics series, and
	a few math classes, you should be allowed to declare a major in CS.
		- Similar requirements for CSE (some might differ).
		- If you want to declare a CS major, your GPA should be above 3.

## Advantages of taking more math/stats classes

- A lot of computer science is mathematics and Statistics than it is Programming.

- Regardless of the specific field of CS that you might be interested in,
	there is an equivalent class offered by either the mathematics or statistics
	department.

- Take the classes from these departments to learn these topics from a
	different perspective. You will learn a lot more and things might make
	more sense to you.

- Some of these classes count as electives for your major too and it will
definitely look better on your transcript.
	- You can even petition certain classes to be counted for your electives
	(if they are not already listed as electives)

### Math Classes You Should Definitely Consider Taking

| Class     		|  Title			  	| CS Related Areas 							|
| :------------- 	| :------------ 		| :------------								|
| MAT 108       	| Abstract Mathematics  | Logic, discrete structures				|
| MAT 115A       	| Number Theory       	| Cryptography, Security					|
| MAT 127A/B       	| Real Analysis      	| Probability Theory, Randomized Algorithms	|
| MAT 133       	| Mathematical Finance  | Finance Modeling							|
| MAT 145       	| Combinatorics		  	| Graph Theory, Algorithms, Cryptography	|
| MAT 148       	| Discrete Mathematics  | Cryptography, Ergodic Theory, Security	|
| MAT 167       	| Applied Lin. Algebra  | Data Science, ML/AI						|
| MAT 168       	| Optimization       	| Data Science, ML/AI 						|

## CS vs CSE

- CSE as a major focuses roughly on 80% CS and about 20% in EE. If you're
interested in hardware and working with embedded systems, then you should
definitely be a CSE major.

- CSE has a lot of core requirements to complete. There are 3 EE classes that
you must take, the entire physics 9 series and a math class on differential
equations. All of these classes are considered to be core engineering classes.

- There's only room for 4 electives that you can take. Some might see this as
not enough room to try out other classes because of the heavy course load.

- If you're interested in any other specific subfield of CS, you should
probably be a CS major since you have more flexibility to take classes that
you might be interested in. Additionally, it is a lot more easier to double
major or minor in another field!

- _If you know that you want to be involved in software development, the
job opportunities are about the same regardless of choosing CS or CSE as your
major_
