# Classes Outline

## CS Classes Overview

### First Year CS Classes and Expectations

- CS classes operate differently than a traditional Math, Physics, or any
other class.
	- Programming assignments are longer than they seem.
	- Working with a partner is highly encouraged.
	- Understanding how to solve a problem in a text level is actually different
	than programming the solution.
	-  Programming assignments are worth more than
	anything else (roughly 40-50% of your grade sometimes)

- Here we provide what a student can expect taking the lower division classes.
 	- This is not providing you with course descriptions. See the department
	website for that.
	- This just tells you what you can expect and provides other insights that
	one would wish they knew as a freshman taking these classes.

- Lower division CS classes are more programming intensive (with the exception
	 of ECS 20).
	- **ECS 36A and 36B** are meant to teach you the fundamentals of computer
	programming and help you design simple algorithms.
		- _36A will be taught in Python!_
		- 36B is meant to be hard and is the first weeder course that the
		department offers.
		- Expect to program a lot in 36B.
		- _36B will be taught in C++_
	- **ECS 36C** is the course that coverts you from being just a programmer
	 to an actual computer scientist.
		- This is a programming heavy course too!
		- If you are not comfortable with OOP (36B),
		this course will break you.
		- Typically the second weeder course the department offers.
	- **ECS 50** teaches you the basics of assembly programming and basic
	computer operations.
		- Generally not a hard class. Typically of the easier
		and less stressful lower division classes in the department.
		- Good intro to computer architecture. debugging assembly language is
		strenuous.
		- You'll learn a little bit about how your computer works.
	- **ECS 20** is a course on discrete mathematics.
		- No programming
		- People generally take this class less seriously but it is the foundation
		of what is actually termed "computer science"
		- The material also comes up in technical interviews.
		- Foundation for a lot of upper division classes.
		- If you want to go to grad school, you better do well in this class!

_Non - Major and Minor Lower Division CS classes_

- **ECS 32A** is an introductory class in programming. This class is intended
for non-majors and students who have had no prior programming experience. This class will be taught in _Python_.

- **ECS 32B** is a class on teaching you the principles of object oriented programming, and data structures in _Python_.

- **ECS 34** is a transition (and a weeder) course to become a part of the major.
	- Will cover extensive OOP principles and the UNIX OS!
