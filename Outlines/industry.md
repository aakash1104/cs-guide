## Internship Structures
* Internships are generally 10-12 weeks from June to September. Most companies will assign you a mentor who will hopefully be open to answering your questions for your projects. 
Don't be too discouraged if you don't understand everything at first; codebases can be millions of lines of code with tons of technologies you probably haven't even heard before.
* Often times, there'll be a presentation at the end of the internship. 

## Transition to FT
* Typically your internship at a company is already your application to work there full time. Companies host internships to net better engineers earlier, so they are in essence interviewing you
throughout the summer. Take this opportunity to network with other interns, understand and learn about how the product works, and learn about potential roles you're interested in.

## Off season internships
* Some larger companies have off season internships as well. You'll probably have to skip a quarter or two for these, but they're extremely rewarding.
