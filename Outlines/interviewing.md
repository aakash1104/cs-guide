## Getting Interviews

**There are three ways to get interviews.**
1. The first and best way is to leverage your network to get a referral or a shoe in the door. This can come in many forms -- family friends, friends, professors, asking people on LinkedIn out for coffee to pick their brain and making a good impression, etc.

2. The second way is to create a really good, company-specific project and show it to them. Send it to their CEO or someone high up who'll understand the impact of your project. A project of this size may take 1-2 days, but basically guarantees your interview. Keeping in mind that
you'll maybe apply to 10-20 places in two days in that same time and most people only get around 1-2% reply rates, and this option is actually quite good. You'll also simultaneously be building your portfolio and skill set.

3. Finally, the third and worst way is to "spray and pray". Here, you apply
to as many companies as you can and it is truly a number's game. Keep in mind here that your odd's of getting an interview are additive, so you literally increase your odds of getting an interview with every application. Some good places to start looking for these are
[j-delaney's list](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) of easy applications, [intern.supply](https://intern.supply), or [hackernews's monthly job postings thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17442187).

## Side/Personal Projects

* You do side and personal projects for personal interest and to build up your experience/attractiveness to companies. Do projects that you find interesting that actually go past your skill set so you'll always be learning something new. Often times, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how simply
something makes sense.
* On top of this, I highly recommend pitching your ideas to a professor or running them by a startup incubator. Perhaps there are other opportunities there. Professors have strong networks and great experience for you to learn from, and you never know if you'll have the chance
to publish a paper.
* Similarly, running a startup is a unique, highly sought-after experience by companies. If you don't get an internship, don't fret. Do an extremely significant project. A friend of a friend wanted to get into the game development industry and applied everywhere, but got no responses.
That summer, he developed a game engine. The subsequent summer, all of the biggest companies in game dev wanted him far more than people with typical internships. **Make your time matter.**

## Building your portfolio website
* Your portfolio website should be self-made (unless you are absolutely sure you will never have to understand how web pages work), and should be an accurate image of your capabilities and interests.
* Don't put vulgar or inappropriate content here; employers will and **DO** look you up. Don't let this mess up
your opportunities. This is a good opportunity to learn (at very minimum) some front-end like HTML, CSS, SASS, or even something more advanced like Vue, React, or Angular. Similarly, you can also add backend features. You can talk about all of these during the interview and yes, relevant questions come up often.

## Building your resume
* Use a one-column resume **(read: not deedy)** that's pdf parsable. The vast majority of companies simply use [ATS's](https://www.rchilli.com/blog/resume-parser-and-ats-lets-be-friends-again) with resume parsing so if your resume doesn't parse well, good luck getting an interview. You can test out how
your resume parses with [this](https://www.joinvision.com/en/products/cvlizer).
* Small companies (100-200 ppl) typically get 200-400 applications on an entry level/internship role on just
*the first day*. Out of those, they'll probably interview 30 and pick up 2. Apply a week later and your resume will never even see the light of day.
* Be early to apply; turn on notifications and trackers. In your resume, frame everything in the form
<verb> x by using <y> to achieve <z> where z is a quantifiable metric. This helps the company accurately (or more accurately) understand the impact of your work.
* Have a list of skills near the top as well as your GPA if over 3.0. If your GPA isn't over 3.0, prioritize that heavily; many companies will simply
cut you off automatically if you don't hit a certain threshold.
* Once you have technical experience or if you're a 3rd or 4th year, remove irrelevant work experiences (cashier, waitress, etc). Put in side projects to fill the space if you don't have enough work experience. **Never go over 1 page.**  

### Feedback
You can get feedback from friends and faculty, or try reaching out to people in the [Davis CS club page](https://www.facebook.com/daviscsclub/), or any other professional connections you have. However, the vast majority of companies will not give feedback as it makes them liable to lawsuits. A good way to practice interviews/improving your resume is to
practice whiteboarding in front of your friends. Explaining these concepts is significantly different from simply understanding them. Both communication skills as well as technical knowledge are necessary for the job.

### UC Davis South Hall (ICC)

* You can go to the ICC to get some resume review or career help. I've found that they have a nice list of listservs, so sign up for the relevant ones.


## Interview Prep/Best Habits

* Unfortunately, interviews these days can be largely simplified to leetcode. Studying leetcode or similar sites (hackerrank, careercup, etc) is quite effective, although boring and uneventful. Be prepared to answer questions like these, code in a language you're comfortable in, and explain your thought process.
Have good whiteboard management -- write on the upper left always. Trust me, it works. Make sure you have running code and not just comments. Rather than having arrows moving code around, call a helper function. It'll help immensely when they can copy/paste your code into an editor and have it work. Whenever
the interviewer talks, listen. They're talking for a reason; interrupting them or otherwise stopping them from voicing their concern is disadvantageous.

* Try to do a set number of questions a day and simply choose hard questions that you can do. Don't spend over 1.5h on a question; just look at the answer, understand it, and move on. Come back to it in a week when you've forgotten the answer and re-solve.
	* Here is a schedule to solve interview questions everyday:
		1. Start off with an easy problem to warm up your brain. The question can be
		as simple as a easy linked list insertion.
		2. Do about 5-8 medium level problems. If you're stuck for more than an hour,
		just look at the solution and try to redo it!
		Don't just read the solution. Try to understand why
		that works, and then redo the problem.
		3. If you're feeling confident, then do a hard level problem.
		4. Finally either end with a review of problems you just did and try to think
		why those solutions are the optimal solutions!


* Before you take your interview, try to look at [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm).
They have interview questions from almost all the companies.
Make sure you look over those too. If you're lucky, you might encounter the
exact same problem that you saw on the company's glassdoor!

## A Day Before the Interview

* Don't overdo it a day before the interview. You need to be as relaxed as
possible before your interview.

* Try not to learn new concepts. Instead, just review everything that you have
done so far. If you have marked a few concepts to review, then review those!

* It might be a good idea to redo some leetcode, hackerrank problems that you have already encountered.
Don't do new ones and confuse yourself.

* Review some concepts of Object Oriented Programming. They definitely come
up during interviews.

* Additionally, make sure you're also comfortable about the
programming language of your choice to a point where you can
talk to your interviewer about certain implementations.
This will definitely impress the interviewer.

* **Finally, review your Big-Oh's**. Every interviewer expects you to know your
time complexities!

## During the Interview

Interviews typically have many mostly unrelated things to do, so here is a list. Most onsite interviews will be in a single room with interviewers coming in and out, or they will move you from room to room.
* Introduce yourself at the start of the interview
* Understand the question well before you begin answering. It is easier to answer correctly but slowly rather than backtrack.
* Ask questions at the end of the interview. This is an opportunity for you to interview the company as well.
* This is your opportunity to figure out if the company has interesting, applicable work for you with growth opportunities.

### How to Present Yourself

Interviewing is an art, and it will also be a life-long challenge. There are so many traits that you're being assessed for, i.e being personable, creative, patience, clarity in expression, but thinking about this will just induce nervousness. The best interviews tend to happen when you authentically represent yourself. This is cliche, but the best interviews are a conversation. Interviewers are able to sniff out lack of authenticity or attempts to make oneself appear better than you actually are. Passion is able to show, so make an active effort to discuss projects/experiences that you thoroughly enjoyed.
Interviewers are people, too.

## The Offer
* After you have finished all the interviews, they will come back with a result. If your result is positive, congratulations! You're almost done. At this point, the recruiter will typically give a verbal offer -- letting you know that
they plan on extending you one. This call or email typically tells you about the salary, benefits, team, etc. However, keep in mind that this does **NOT** mean you actually have an offer. Nothing matters until you
have a physical (or DocuSign) offer in hand. At this point, you'll have some amount of time to accept the offer.

* Typically it is nice of a company to give you a while to decide: in theory, they should want you to make the
best professional choice, regardless of whether or not it is them. However, this is not true, and many companies will purposely give you short deadlines to pressure you into accepting.
