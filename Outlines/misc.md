## Tech Conferences

Tech Conferences are an untapped resource by students. When starting out, tech conferences provide an opportunity to meet others in industry interested in similar technical domains, attend break-outs(informational sessions), and participate in hands-on labs. Apply to conferences - reach out to people for complimentary passes or admissions. Get involved with programs which will sponsor you - i.e remote internships, ambassadorships, technical competitions. Industry is more encouraging and open to student involvement more than ever before.  Conferences also help you with that first step-in-the-door -- you may be reaching out to the same person you meet at Conf XYZ for a referral, or even for mentorship. Just google for a tech conference related to a topic you're interested in, and search for hashtags for the same conference on Twitter.
