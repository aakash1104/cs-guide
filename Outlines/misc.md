## Tech Conferences

Tech Conferences are an untapped resource by students. When starting out, tech conferences provide an opportunity to meet others in industry interested in similar technical domains, attend break-outs(informational sessions), and participate in hands-on labs. Apply to conferences - reach out to people for complimentary passes or admissions. Get involved with programs which will sponsor you - i.e remote internships, ambassadorships, technical competitions. Industry is more encouraging and open to student involvement more than ever before.  Conferences also help you with that first step-in-the-door -- you may be reaching out to the same person you meet at Conf XYZ for a referral, or even for mentorship. Just google for a tech conference related to a topic you're interested in, and search for hashtags for the same conference on Twitter. 

## Inferiority Complexes

The college environment, with its constant emphasis on academic achievement and finding jobs, unfortunately leads many students to develop feelings of inferiority and inadequacy. Seeing one's peers with higher grades or better internships can be disheartening, but it is important to remember these facts:

### 1. Others' successes are not your failures

It's easy for one to discount their own achievements based on the achievements of others. Even if you think someone's assignment/project is better than your own, do not dismiss your work. Rather than lament how you could not do what others could, be proud that you gave an earnest effort.

### 2. You are not behind

Many students are afraid that they are behind their peers in terms of career advancement, whether it's related to classes taken or jobs acquired. Although it certainly important to strive for success, living in constant fear of being behind is mentally destructive. Even if you're taking a class later than suggested or did not find an internship for a summer, it just means you're taking your degree at a pace that is right for you.

### 3. The actions you need to take do not change

This may seem obvious, but a fear of failure should not prevent students from passing their classes and applying for jobs. While inferiority complexes can cause overwhelming feelings of self-defeat and pessimism, studying and sending job applications are still a student's responsibilities.

## Impostor Syndrome

Impostor syndrome is a slightly different mindset, characterized by self-doubt and the fear that one will be exposed as a "fraud." Symptoms of impostor syndrome include feeling like your achievments are solely due to luck, or that you've "tricked" others into thinking that you're better than you actually are. This feeling occurs in individuals of all genders and ethnicities, but can be especially intense for women or minorities. To handle these feelings, it can be helpful to remember these facts:

### 1. You are not alone

Many, *many* people feel this way. A well-respected CS professor at UC Davis expressed that he had impostor syndrome, even after four years of college and completing a doctorate. The fact is, people will inevitably feel as if they don't belong. To combat this, it's important to find a group of people with which you feel accepted and supported.

### 2. The actions you need to take do not change (again)

A bit of a cop-out to re-use this point, but it deserves reiteration. Feeling like a fraud doesn't change what you have to do.
