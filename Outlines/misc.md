## Tech Conferences

Tech Conferences are an extremely unutilized resource by students. When starting out, tech conferences provide an opportunity to attend break-outs(informational sessions), hands-on labs, and to especially meet others in industry interested in similar technical domains. Apply to conferences - reach out to people for complimentary passes or admissions. Get involved with programs which will sponsor you - i.e remote internships, ambassadorships, technical competitions. Industry is more encouraging and open to student involvement more than ever before.  Conferences also help you with that first step-in-the-door -- you may be reaching out to the same person you meet at Conf XYZ for a referral, or even for mentorship. Just google for a tech conference related to a topic you're interested in, and search for hashtags for the same conference on Twitter. 

## Imposter Syndrome

There's this culture of Silcon Valley which embraces the Zuck phrase of "Move fast and break things". Things are constantly changing, and the UC curriculum isn't always revamped quickly enough to parallel new technologies and breakthroughs present in industry.
