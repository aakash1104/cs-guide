# Research Outline

## Research in CS for undergrads

- Davis is primarily a research based institute, and undergrad research is
highly encouraged.

- If you're interested in doing research in a CS related field, there are tons
of opportunities for undergrads.
	- Tons of undergrad research in the CS and Math department!

### How to ask a professor about potentially working with them?

- First, and most importantly, make sure you know what they research in.
Make sure you're interested in what they do. If you don't know what they work
on or if you're not interested in what they work on, they won't prefer to work
with you.

- Make sure the professor knows you. Ideally, it would help your chances if
you have taken a class with them. Going to office hours is a nice way to get
to know your professor. You can even ask them questions about research,
and they would be more than delighted to talk about their work!
	- Nothing impresses a professor more than knowing that you're interested
	in their work!
		- Of course, don't fake it just to "do research and enhance your profile"

- You don't have to read all of their papers and solved every single question
that they pose in their papers. You just have to show them that you're
passionate and interested in working with them.

- Don't display yourself or your profile as something like:

> "I'm a sophomore interested in working with you. I have 4.0 GPA and an A+
in data structures. I think I'm skilled enough to work with you"

That's a huge red flag! Please don't do that.

- Talk to the professor about your goals and why you might be interested in
research.
	- If they don't have suitable projects for you, they can recommend you to
	someone else.

- If you're interested in core CS research, then focus of doing research with
a professor in the department (or maybe few professors from the math department)
