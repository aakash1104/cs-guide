# Research Outline

## Research in CS for undergrads

- Davis (and all UC's) is primarily a research based institute, and undergrad research is
highly encouraged.

- If you're interested in doing research in a CS related field, there are tons
of opportunities for undergrads.
	- Tons of undergrad research in the CS and Math department!

### How to ask a professor about potentially working with them?

- First, and most importantly, make sure you know what they research in.
Make sure you're interested in what they do. If you don't know what they work
on or if you're not interested in what they work on, they won't prefer to work
with you.

- Make sure the professor knows you. Ideally, it would help your chances if
you have taken a class with them. Going to office hours is a nice way to get
to know your professor. You can even ask them questions about research,
and they would be more than delighted to talk about their work!
	- Nothing impresses a professor more than knowing that you're interested
	in their work!
		- Of course, don't fake it just to "do research and enhance your
		profile"

- You don't have to read all of their papers and solved every single question
that they pose in their papers. You just have to show them that you're
passionate and interested in working with them.

- Don't display yourself or your profile as something like:

	> "I'm a sophomore interested in working with you. I have 4.0 GPA and an A+
in data structures. I think I'm skilled enough to work with you"

	That's a huge red flag! Please don't do that.

- Talk to the professor about your goals and why you might be interested in
research.
	- If they don't have suitable projects for you, they can recommend you to
	someone else.

- If you're interested in core CS research, then focus of doing research with
a professor in the department (or maybe few professors from the math department)

### Research in CS for freshmen and sophomores

- There are professors within the CS department that do take in freshmen
and sophomores for research projects.

- As a freshman or a sophomore, you may not have done extensive coursework
or taken courses that require you to apply concepts from other classes,
but as long as you do well in them and are a fast learner,
you can most certainly impress the faculty and have them consider you for a
project.

- The most important thing to do is to exhibit your exuberance and
passion for learning.

- Be eager to learn and display that to your professor, and you'll be a
great candidate for research.

- Research is more learning and studying than you may think.
	> If we knew what it is we were doing, it would not be called research,
	would it?	~Albert Einstein

- Most importantly: don't hesitate to ask a faculty member for a research
position. If you like their work, just email them and schedule a meeting.
Talk to them about how you're interested in working with them and show
them that you are excited to learn more about their field.
	- It is completely okay to be rejected for a research position.

	- Don't worry too much about it. If you're still interested,
	talk to them after you've taken a few classes and tell them that
	you're still interested.

- You can also check the Undergraduate Research Center located in the
Student Community Center for more research opportunities.

## Applying for positions in research labs

- Applying for internship or full time positions in research labs is slightly
different than applying for any other tech job.

- For instance, research labs have a GPA requirement (and they make no
exceptions). Some research labs have a minimum GPA of 3.0 whereas some
prestigious research labs have a GPA limit of 3.5 and above.

- Technical interviews are more focussed on what is on your resume.
For example: If you have mention in your resume that you have a side project
built in _Unity_, then expect to be quizzed on some intricate details of
Unity.

- Research labs might also ask for professional references so make sure,
you have at least 2 professional references who can talk highly about you
and your work ethic.

- A fair warning: Positions for research labs are very competitive! So
be sure to bring out your best.

## "Side"/Academic projects

- Personal projects from an academia standpoint might be different than your
typical side projects.
	- You won't be making Alexa skills to remind you about classes and that
	sort of stuff.

- The easiest way to have a personal academic project is to pick some
interesting concept(s) or topic(s) and dive deeper into it.
	- You could study about related topics or try to determine the relation
	between two similar topics.

- Sometimes, a professor would love to work with you on a project that you
find interesting (if they have the time of course).

## Presenting @ URC

- If you are involved in research with a professor (or multiple people),
or even if you're doing research by yourself, you can present your
research in the undergrad research conference.

- You don't need to have a "finished" product to participate. You can
even talk about what you did, and what you plan to do in the future.
	- It is completely okay if you don't have a product to give a demo
	to your audience.

- You can even get a transcript notation indicating that you've done research
and get units for this!
