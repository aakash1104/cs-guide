## Academics

### Larger Class Sizes
Setting foot in a 200-person class after being used to class sizes of 40 or fewer can be shocking to a lot of students transferring in from community college. The biggest difference when comparing smaller class sizes to larger ones is that you receive significantly less one-on-one attention from the instructor/professor. 

There are typically fewer lectures per week than you had in community college and only one or two weekly office hours held by the instructor/professor. However, there are TA office hours that will supplement these; in fact, the TA office hours are where you will be asking most questions related to your homework and/or programming assignments, since many instructors and professors prefer to answer more high-level conceptual questions about the course material during their office hours. Discussions can also be a helpful feature of the 4-year university system and can provide an opportunity for you to ask your TA questions during the week.

At a four-year university, there is also greater opportunity to form study groups with your classmates and peers. In community college, it can sometimes be difficult to form dependable, long-lasting groups since CC students are generally commuting from all over the place. At Davis, however, you’ll be running into a lot of the same students over and over again as you take similar paths in completing your degree requirements. Take advantage of this and make a genuine attempt to connect with your classmates in lecture.

## Getting Internships and Experience

### Introduction and Basic Resources
Transferring into UCD CS after 2 or more years at a community college, you may not be aware of a lot of basic resources that will help you tremendously in finding job and internship opportunities, preparing for technical interviews, and improving your technical skills. Outlined below are a few of these resources:

1.	**Career Fairs**
    Career fairs happen 3-4 times a year. Here’s the 2018-2019 schedule. If you can, go to every single one! Physically handing in your resume to an actual person increases your chances of landing an interview by a whole lot, compared to desperately submitting hundreds of applications online – especially with little to no prior relevant experience. 

    A lot of transfer students decide not to go to the career fair the fall or winter of their first year at Davis, and this is a mistake. Remember: you’re competing with folks that have been at Davis since their freshman year, and have possibly already had the opportunity to intern at one or two places during their undergraduate career. You’ve come into Davis with an already shortened timeline, so don’t waste it.

    **Crafting Your Pitch**

        Career fairs are essentially made up of hundreds of booths/tables set up by various companies. You stand in line at the booths you’re interested in and when it’s your turn, you basically have 30 seconds to hand your resume to the recruiter at the booth and pitch yourself. Crafting a decent pitch is therefore crucial to having a successful career fair experience.

        The ICC sometimes holds workshops to help students craft their pitch. This could be helpful if you have a little anxiety and need to practice saying your pitch aloud to other people or if you need some guidance on what to say in order to sell yourself. (Link to a past event?)

        Alternatively, writing out your pitch and then practicing with a friend (particularly one that has already experienced a career fair or two) could help.

        Something else that might help is recording yourself practicing your pitch. Replay the video, pinpoint where your delivery needs improvement, and repeat until you’re satisfied.

2.	**Leetcode and Other Technical Interview Prep Resources**

    So… what happens when you actually land an interview? Most interviews for technical internship and job positions will involve some form of a “technical interview.” This interview often consists of a standard style/format of technical questions related to data structures and algorithms. Practicing for these interviews is a lot like practicing math problems: you just have to do a lot of them before you start to get better. So where do you find these practice problems?

    One such resource is Leetcode: https://leetcode.com is a pretty standard resource for both new and seasoned technical folks when it comes to interview prep. You can filter questions by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard – note: most interview questions are going to be in the “easy” and “medium” range, particularly for internships and new grad jobs) and topic (Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.).

    Similar resources include but are not limited to: HackerRank, codility, and two very popular books, Cracking the Coding Interview and Elements of Programming Interviews.


3.	**You can get involved in research!**

    (For more detail, I’d like to point you towards the Research section of this guide.)

    A lot of transfer students are worried about not being good enough for a research programming job. The thing is, there’s a variety of opportunities for research, from more basic positions to the more advanced. 

    Basic roles may involve some simple Python scripting or web scraping, and they’re good opportunities for you to learn and grow your skills, not only with regards to raw programming but also self-studying, working with professors and other students, reading Stackoverflow answers as well as official language and framework documentation, and most importantly, becoming a master Google-searcher. 

    So don’t shy away from applying! You can find these roles on Aggie Job Link as well as through weekly department-wide emails. (Don’t ignore those emails! There are interesting opportunities advertised in almost every single one of them, and you don’t know what you might come across.)

4.	**You can become a tutor.**

    Briefly mention rules for tutoring eligibility + link to tutoring website.

5.	**Attend the annual HackDavis hackathon (and other hackathons too).**

    As a transfer student who may not have had a ton of exposure to things like internships and hackathons in their first two years, it would be helpful for you to go out and build things to get a feel for some technologies you might like to work with (it’s totally okay to suck at first: you have to put yourself out there and attempt to figure things out and make stuff in order to get better). 

    Hackathons present a great opportunity to do just this. They’re 24-72 hour-events (depending on the hackathon) in which you form a team and create a Thing. This Thing can be a web app, mobile app, or hardware prototype, depending on the hackathon’s specific rules and guidelines as well as your and your team’s interests.

    Here’s the link to HackDavis’s webpage, and here’s a list of nationwide university hackathons that you can apply to. Pay special attention to the ones in California; there is often (but not always) sponsored transport that will take you to the hackathon.

## Some more basic steps to take:

(Warning: some of this advice may be repetitive but I thought a few of the points mentioned above deserved a specific section of their own.) 

1.	**Work on your resume, stat.**
    If you don’t have a resume yet, you need to make one right away. There are plenty of resources online to help out with that. Just google something all the lines of “software engineer resume” or “software engineer intern resume” and you’ll find a bunch of examples you can model yours after.

2.	**Set up a website/portfolio.**
    Setting up a simple portfolio website (you can host one site for free if you have a Github account, link to more info here) can get you familiar with basic HTML/CSS/Javascript if you aren’t already and help you “advertise” yourself to potential employers. You can provide a link to this website/portfolio on your resume as well.

    Your website should contain a list of projects you’ve worked on (in the beginning, class projects are fine but over time, it would be helpful to link to things you’ve built outside of class) as well as a link to the code or better yet, a live version of the application (particularly if it’s a web app).

3.	**Work on strengthening weak fundamentals and improving your skills.**
    Some transfers feel that they did not develop their fundamentals in basic data structures and algorithms enough during their years at community college. To those transfers, I advise you to start practicing ASAP. During your first quarter, focus on adjusting to classes, but after that, get started with sites like Leetcode. Leetcode problems will force you to confront and work with basic data structures. It might be really difficult when you start, but stick to it and you will get better in time. 

    Also, start making things: set up a simple portfolio website and/or attend a hackathon or two, if possible. These things won’t help you master data structures and algorithms, but they will expose you to some very basic technologies and give you practice doing things like reading documentation, effectively googling technical problems, and working with APIs. 

    Additionally, make a Github if you haven’t already! Git is a super important version control tool that you’ll be working with both at Davis and in industry, so it’s best if you familiarize yourself with it ASAP.
