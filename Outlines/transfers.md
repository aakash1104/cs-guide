# Transfers Outline

## Academics
This section is intended specifically for students transferring from a local CC to UC Davis.

### Adjusting to larger class sizes: how to deal? 
- Peer groups + TA office hours are the primary way
- Prof. office hours should be attended a few times a quarter, can be valuable but won’t provide the kind of personal attention that instructor office hours at CC often did

## Getting Internships

### Intro
Transfer-oriented section on pursuing internships. Addresses being weak on CS and software fundamentals and how transfers that feel (or are!) a bit (or very!) behind can catch up to their 4-year peers.

### Basic Steps To Take
- Create or update resume (a tiny section explaining the obvious with a couple tidbits specific to transfer students; don’t want to waste time repeating any part of the “Industry” section of the guide)
- Go to every single career fair (the first career fair for a fresh transfer is totally different than the first career fair for a freshman and so deserves its own section)
- Be on the lookout for recruiter events
- Leetcode/HackerRank
- On other industry advice: refer to main industry chapter

### Transfer-Specific Concerns
- Weak Fundamentals from CC courses: how to address them in time to land an internship?
	- Weak on Data Structures and Algorithms
	- Weak on basic software practices and tools like version control, etc.
		- Make a damn GitHub and use it!
		- Help! I don’t know how to program!
			- First of all: this is a yikES situation of the highESt oRDeR
			- Now that the yikes are out of the way: HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS. 

### Get an On-Campus Job
This is obviously not just transfer-specific: I’d encourage any CS student to get an on-campus programming job if possible. The reason I want to mention this in the Transfers chapter is because brand new transfers often have no idea about the opportunities available to them on campus and due to the severely shortened time they have at UC Davis, they need to be brought up-to-speed ASAP.

- Not feeling or being qualified
- If you’re a little bit qualified, definitely apply and learn on-the-job if you’re hired
